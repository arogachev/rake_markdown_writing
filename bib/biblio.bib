	abstract = {This significantly updated new edition of Developing Java Softwareis a thorough presentation of object–oriented design andprogramming concepts using the Java 5 programming language. Thebook takes the reader from the basics of using Java 5 to thecreation of complete, object–oriented programs. Following an   objects early    approach, the core elements of the Javalanguage are covered, including the use of recently added featuressuch as generics.  The encouragement of the proper creation and use of classes, andthe demonstration of the strategies used to create good qualitycode are at the core of this book. You will learn how Java programswork and how they can be designed and implemented in an organizedand systematic way. In addition, the book addresses how a Javaprogramming project should be managed and introduces the Ant buildtool and the Subversion version control system. Testing has always been an important part of Developing JavaSoftware. This edition provides new chapters which give a detailedintroduction to Test–driven Development (TDD). This approach toprogramming introduces more rigor to writing programs by placingemphasis on writing high quality testable and tested code from theoutset. A series of examples and case studies shows how TDD worksand highlights the strategies for testing code. Reflecting recent changes to the Java programming language andnewly focused on first courses in programming, this excellentprimer is ideal for classroom use or self–study. The manymotivating examples and larger case studies show how core ideas canbe applied when creating real applications, and show how to useobject–oriented methods effectively to create robust, reliable, andfully–tested Java applications.},
